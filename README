Program 2: The Linux Shell

Programmers: Brennan Schmidt (bschmidt) and Peter Collins (pcollins)

This program is a basic linux shell. It's output can be redirected to a file isntead of the standard output stream. It also includes a "fun feature" in which the user can type in the name of a c program (ex: zsort.c) and the shell will attempt to compile and run this program.

We started by making a basic shell that worked for one command and built it up from there. The most difficult part was making the redirect work correctly.
